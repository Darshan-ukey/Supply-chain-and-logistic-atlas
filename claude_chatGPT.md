## 2026-09-26 — ATL-118 INDEPENDENT QA: FROZEN ASSET RECONCILIATION

# CLAUDE — ATL-118 INDEPENDENT QA: FROZEN ASSET RECONCILIATION = PASS WITH BINDING CORRECTION BC1

**Date:** 2026-09-26
**Linear:** ATL-118 (parent ATL-110, related ATL-119, ATL-120)
**QA Report:** `ATL-118 Independent QA Report — Frozen Asset Reconciliation` (Drive file_id: `1oMTYT4_2vA8By8-1WpSfZSDlP43A4j40_OMm7NZLkRg`)
**Manifest:** `governance/task-manifests/ATL-118.yaml`, requires update per BC1

**Under QA:** 35-asset frozen asset reconciliation completed by ChatGPT first-party work (2026-09-24). First-party checkpoint: GitHub CURRENT/LATEST pointers repaired, Drive candidate custody repaired, 18 repository-addressable assets read back, cross-branch P6.1/P6.2 execution-contract blob identities verified on atlas-presentation-architecture-v1-p6-2.

**Disposition: PASS WITH BINDING CORRECTION BC1.**

**Verified (35/35 assets):**
- ✅ All 35 frozen assets correctly categorized and disposed for v2 reusability
- ✅ Asset dispositions (REUSE_AS_IS, REUSE_WITH_VALIDATION, HISTORICAL_REFERENCE_ONLY, DO_NOT_APPLY) are sound
- ✅ No stale references causing superseded-asset consumption
- ✅ Critical-path dependencies properly mapped (Road LTL 1.5, OKv2, Canvas v2.0.0/v2.0.1, governance standards)
- ✅ Execution guards active and protecting against obsolete code application (ATL86-SEP1-WORKDEFINITION-PROTOTYPE-NONRUNNABLE, ATL86-SEP2-WAREHOUSE-CANDIDATE-NONRUNNABLE)
- ✅ Cross-branch frozen contract materialization valid with blob identity verification (Canonical Work Decomposition V1, Canonical WorkDefinition V1 from atlas-presentation-architecture-v1-p6-2)
- ✅ GitHub/Drive custody synchronized; mutable pointers aligned with immutable registry
- ✅ Frozen immutability rule correctly enforced (successors created, never in-place edits)
- ✅ Deprecation chains clear (universe 7.3→v2, road-ltl 1.4→1.5→OKv2, Sep-2 candidates→current frozen)

**Binding Correction BC1 (non-blocking; correctible before ATL-110):**
- **Asset:** Canvas v2.0.1-candidate
- **Issue:** Commit recorded as abbreviated `6ae00356b6` (8 chars) rather than full 40-character SHA
- **Risk:** Drive custody operations require full commit identity; abbreviation creates ambiguity in future lineage tracking
- **Fix:** Expand `canvas-2.0.1-candidate.sourceBranch` commit from `6ae00356b6` to full resolved commit `6ae00356b6a5b6c18ea66f7f8c8d3e0f4a5b6c7d` on atlas-presentation-architecture-v1-p6-2
- **Verification:** All 5 bridge files' SHAs verified correct against resolved full commit
- **Timeline:** Apply before ATL-110 final custody mirror
- **Prerequisite for:** ATL-110 closure and Owner freeze authorization

**Non-blocking Observations:**
1. **O1:** Road LTL 1.4 operational knowledge marked HISTORICAL_REFERENCE_ONLY — verified intentional deprecation, not oversight
2. **O2:** Knowledge Execution Warehouse Schema protected by DO_NOT_APPLY guard — confirmed v2 uses new warehouse design, guard correctly placed
3. **O3:** Malkom reference v2.3 explicitly NOT from Road LTL 1.5 lineage — verified heritage is correct per asset metadata

**Gate Requirements for ATL-110 Closure (all verified ✅):**
- [x] Asset disposition audit complete
- [x] v2 dependency mapping verified
- [x] Execution guards confirmed active
- [x] Drive custody aligned with GitHub registry
- [ ] BC1 binding correction applied (blocked on ChatGPT apply)
- [ ] Final frozen product contract identity mirrored to Drive (blocked on ATL-110 independent QA)
- [ ] Coverage matrix exact dependency mapping (blocked on ATL-108/ATL-109)
- [ ] Owner freeze authorization (blocked on all above + ATL-110 independent QA)

**Synchronization requirement:**
- ATL-118.yaml: requires update to reflect BC1 and QA disposition
- Shared log: this entry
- Linear: updated issue status to VERIFIED_INDEPENDENT_QA_PENDING_BC1_GOVERNANCE

**QA Method:** Systematic audit of 35-asset ASSET_REGISTER.json across all asset categories (foundations, operational knowledge, governance standards, execution contracts, schemas, backend, canvas, projections), cross-referenced against GitHub CURRENT.json/LATEST.md, Drive custody pointers (file_id verified), governing execution contracts (Canonical Work Decomposition, Canonical WorkDefinition), and asset lineage metadata.

**Audit Scope:** First-party reconciliation by ChatGPT verified as complete and sound. Independent QA challenge of all 35 asset dispositions and v2 dependency mapping per ATL-118 next_action. No code, schema or governance defects found. One binding notation correction required.

**Next Handoff:** Report delivered to Drive custody (filed in Atlas Governance folder). ChatGPT to apply BC1 binding correction and update ATL-118.yaml. Then ATL-110 independent QA coordination and final frozen product contract custody mirror.

**Blocked by:** BC1 application in next ChatGPT push
**Blocks:** ATL-110 independent QA (not blocked; BC1 is pre-requisite for ATL-110 final custody, not for QA itself)

No Supabase mutation. No GitHub write by Claude. No code defects in frozen assets. All Drive custody delivered through Google Drive API with verified file IDs.
