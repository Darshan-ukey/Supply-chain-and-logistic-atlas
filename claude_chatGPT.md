# Claude ↔ ChatGPT — Atlas Shared Coordination Log

**Status:** CANONICAL ACTIVE CONTROL LOG  
**Current disposition:** `AR0_2_V2_BOUNDED_CORRECTIONS_CLOSED__READY_FOR_OWNER_FREEZE`

Read this file first. Prior detailed review, recovery, demo and governance state is preserved in Git history. Do not create another coordination/control log.

## 1. Frozen product baseline

Canonical file: `governance/standards/ATLAS_PRODUCT_CONSTITUTION_V1.md`  
Commit: `c126f07fcbf405356a8312377ee934fe0c724b36`

North Star:

> **Atlas is a governed operational intelligence platform that builds a reusable, source-backed model of how work operates, binds it to enterprise reality, and uses that model to understand operations, design transformation, and produce execution-ready specifications.**

Three products on one governed foundation:
1. Operations Intelligence — understand how the client actually operates.
2. Transformation Intelligence — decide what should change and why.
3. Execution Intelligence — define how approved work should operate and make it implementation-ready.

Execution remains outside Atlas.

## 2. AR0.2 active architecture candidate

Working branch: `atlas-architecture-ar0-2-layer-boundary`  
PR: `#10` — **AR0.2: three-product architecture rebase — bounded corrections closed**

Active architecture:
`governance/architecture-refinement/AR0.2/LAYER_BOUNDARY_DECISION_REBASED_V2.md`

Canonical ownership zones:
- Z0 Source / Provenance / Knowledge State
- Z1 Domain Reference & Operational Semantics
- Z2 Enterprise Context / Client Binding
- Z3 Operational Evidence / Actual-State
- Z4 Transformation Decision / Approved Target-State
- Z5 Canonical Execution Semantics
- Z6 Governed Specification / Readiness / Projection Identity
- Z7 Observation / Evidence Reconciliation

Runtime Adapter/Projection sits downstream of Z6. Business execution remains external.

Work Decomposition and Canonical WorkDefinition are execution machinery inside Z5, not Atlas product identity.

## 3. Independent review outcome

Claude exhaustive review commit:
`6eb3131b7747380afbb3ab39ae9f3005f74b30ca`

Claude verification/correction pass:
`58b5bf557d807bf2d6548f9f884d63c3cea687b8`

Verified conclusion:
- three-product rebase is genuine, not relabelled Execution Intelligence;
- no structural Z0–Z7 defect was found;
- asset / engine / projection / runtime separation is sound;
- Work Decomposition / WorkDefinition positioning is sound;
- Client Binding constraint is sound;
- F0–F7 freeze assets and G1–G5 engine treatment are conceptually sound;
- bounded contract-level corrections were required, not layer-model redesign.

Claude corrected two findings from its own first exhaustive-review wording:
1. all three readiness states are already defined in the Product Constitution; the remaining gap is machine-verifiable enforcement, not missing definitions;
2. GitHub is already the intended prompt/template authority; Drive is preservation/custody, not competing G4 prompt authority.

## 4. Bounded corrections — APPLIED

Correction closure file on AR0.2 branch:
`governance/architecture-refinement/AR0.2/BOUNDED_CORRECTIONS_CLOSURE_V1.md`

### BC-1 — Z0 vs Z1 ownership

Closed by explicit distinction:
- **Z0:** source/evidence epistemic state — what is known about the evidence and provenance.
- **Z1:** governed business/domain semantic resolution — what business meaning is known, unresolved or conflicting.

A Z0 evidence conflict may cause a Z1 semantic gap but they are separate governed objects and must not become competing copies.

Mandatory AR0.3 deliverable: **Knowledge-State & Semantic-Gap Contract**.

### BC-2 + BC-5 — Z3 evidence admission + Operations Intelligence depth

Closed at AR0.2 by requiring purpose-bound, semantically mapped, minimum-necessary, reproducible, retention-governed evidence admission.

Atlas is not a general transaction lake or process-mining system of record.

Operations Intelligence may assert cycle-time/performance/friction/rework/exception/variant findings only for evidence populations and windows that are operationally and statistically sufficient, with scope/coverage/limitations explicit.

Mandatory AR0.3 deliverables:
- **Z3 Evidence Admission Contract**;
- **Operational Evidence Snapshot/Reference Contract**;
- **Operations Intelligence Analysis Contract**.

### BC-3 — readiness enforcement

No definition correction is required; all three states remain as defined in the Product Constitution:
- `DOMAIN_EXECUTION_READY`
- `ENTERPRISE_EXECUTION_READY`
- `RUNTIME_IMPLEMENTATION_READY`

Mandatory AR0.3 deliverable: deterministic **Readiness Verification Contract / Resolver** that:
- evaluates exact version-closed scope;
- fails closed on unresolved mandatory predecessor gaps;
- enforces monotonicity across readiness states;
- exposes blockers/dependency chain;
- records verifier/rule-set/proof identity;
- is deterministic for the same frozen inputs/rules.

Readiness is derived proof, not manually asserted canonical truth.

### BC-4 — prompt/template custody

No architecture change required.
- GitHub remains governed authority for prompts/templates/instructions/code/rules/config definitions.
- F2 freeze records exact generation identity.
- Drive may preserve recovery copies without becoming competing authority.

AR0.3 must cross-reference this in G4 Generator Contracts.

## 5. Mandatory AR0.3 correction-derived scope

AR0.3 may not close without:
1. Knowledge-State & Semantic-Gap Contract;
2. Z3 Evidence Admission Contract;
3. Operational Evidence Snapshot/Reference Contract;
4. Operations Intelligence Analysis Contract;
5. Readiness Verification Contract / Resolver specification;
6. G4 generator custody cross-reference;
7. test vectors for Z3 admission/refusal and fail-closed readiness behavior.

These are contract-level obligations. They do not create a new top-level zone.

## 6. Generation/recovery governance — remains frozen

Canonical standard:
`governance/standards/CANONICAL_GENERATION_AND_FREEZE_ASSET_STANDARD_V1.md`

Commit: `58d6d0572636ad40f86943a39350b7237bb48f76`

Mandatory generation chain:

`FROZEN INPUTS → VERSIONED GENERATOR CONTRACT → GENERATOR IMPLEMENTATION → VALIDATOR/QA → GOVERNED OUTPUT → HASH/IDENTITY → CUSTODY/RECOVERY RECORD`

Important rule: generative/LLM output may create candidates, but approved canonical recovery must never depend on reproducing an identical future LLM response. Preserve exact approved output and generation/validation evidence.

Controlled phase standard remains:
`governance/standards/CONTROLLED_PHASE_EXECUTION_AND_RECOVERY_GATE_V1.md`

Latest refinement commit: `a523ad3ac1288e68a6dfc764d8c2aa5ea77a2644`

## 7. Physical responsibility direction

- **GitHub:** governance, schemas/contracts, generator/compiler/resolver code, prompts/rules, migrations, adapter/projection code, release manifests and technical registries.
- **Canonical Structured Knowledge Store:** logical queryable/versioned Atlas knowledge/state authority; current target implementation may use Supabase/Postgres where appropriate, subject to AR0.3 schema/security design.
- **Google Drive / immutable custody:** source preservation, frozen release/export packages, independent recovery copies and evidence bundles.
- **Vercel:** presentation/API runtime only; never canonical knowledge or generator authority.

No production Supabase mutation is authorized by this architecture correction.

## 8. Work division

Working operating model, unless Owner changes it:
- **ChatGPT:** architecture/contract authorship, governance standards, phase-closure/control intelligence, Owner-facing synthesis.
- **Claude:** heavy implementation, ground-truth verification, migrations/generators/resolvers/projection implementation, recovery drills.
- **Crossed QA is mandatory:** neither agent certifies its own material work.
- executing agent does not close its own phase gate;
- disagreement escalates to Owner rather than being resolved by deference.

## 9. Current gate

**AR0.2 V2 is not yet Owner-frozen.**

Current state:

`INDEPENDENT REVIEW COMPLETE → BOUNDED CORRECTIONS CLOSED → OWNER FREEZE DECISION REQUIRED`

If Owner freezes AR0.2 V2:
1. freeze exact PR/commit identity and correction closure;
2. record AR0.2 phase closure under the Controlled Phase Execution & Recovery Gate;
3. merge/promote the frozen architecture baseline as governed;
4. authorize AR0.3 Candidate Contract / Physical Architecture;
5. keep R0.4/P6.x suspended until their later governed re-entry gate.

## 10. Hard stops

Until Owner freeze:
- no architecture implementation;
- no AR0.3 schema/table/engine implementation;
- no production Supabase mutation;
- no R0.4/P6.x restart;
- no bulk WorkDefinition materialization;
- no remaining Road LTL task reconstruction;
- no production promotion;
- no client binding used to hide reusable domain knowledge gaps;
- no runtime adapter used to repair missing business semantics;
- no UI/demo JSON treated as canonical business truth;
- no generated governed asset without Generator Contract + Generation Registry + applicable F0–F7 freeze/recovery path.
